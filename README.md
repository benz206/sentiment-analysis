# Web Scraping + Sentiment Analysis

Uh time to figure this out.

## Task
To get everyone started and aligned, here’s a task that blends web scraping and sentiment analysis:

Choose a trending topic you’re interested in (e.g., interest rates, electric vehicles, Elon Musk, Champions League, etc.).
Scrape recent news headlines or article summaries related to your topic using Python (sources like Google News, Yahoo News, Reddit, etc.).
Perform sentiment analysis on the collected text using any method you prefer—VADER, TextBlob, HuggingFace models, etc.
Summarize your findings in any format you like. This could include:
A few bullet points describing sentiment trends
A short writeup
Visualizations (bar charts, word clouds, etc.)
Even an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit) if you’re feeling creative
Share your results (code + summary/output) in the ⁠trial-submission channel by the end of Wednesday, June 11.
Don't worry if you're new to this—it's designed to be a starter task, and we’ll be around to answer questions!
